# Go Leet Code Exercise [![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/arian-amador/GoLeetCode.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/arian-amador/GoLeetCode)

---

Exercise from [https://leetcode.com](https://leetcode.com) written in Go with multiple solutions and tests. Exercise may include multiple ways I went about solving them. I've tried to note some of the highlights of what I've learned to help retain information, as a reference to come back to at a later date, and maybe help others along the way.

Along with sharpening skills I'll be using this as a way to work on my Go skills and pick up some good coding habits.

#### Includes

Inefficient solution, efficient solutions, as much testing as I could figure out to get some unit testing training int, and benchmarking using pprof and other tools along the way.

#### Format

Each exercise is separated into it's own folder. In each of the folders you'll find a `main.go` with all working code, a `main_test.go` with as much unit testing as I could manage at the time, and at times some `*.pprof` files if I was doing any benchmarking/profiling.

I'll also include a `README.md` file per folder as a way to track notes and things learned along the way.
